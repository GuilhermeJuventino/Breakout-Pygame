1) Create a game over system


# Complete

1) Create a window.

2) Create the player pad.

# Possible ideas for polishing the game (After it's finished)

1) Add a glow for the ball, maybe even the platform

2) Add a motion blur (alpha aftereffect) for the ball and/or the platform

3) add screen shake when the ball hits

4) make a crumbling effect for the blocks when breaking

5) add a better background color, preferably gray

6) make the ball white or green
